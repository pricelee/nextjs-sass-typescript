# nextjs-scss-typescript

A starter project.

# Setup

Install `node` with `nvm`

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
# refresh your terminal
$SHELL
# install node
nvm install --lts node
```

run `npm` to install the project dependencies (`npm` comes with `node` and is its package manager)

```bash
npm install
```

That's it, now you can start coding!

# Development

To run the project do `npm run dev`.

# Production

To do a production build do `npm run start`.
